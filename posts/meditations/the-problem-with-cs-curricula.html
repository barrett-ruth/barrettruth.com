              >"On the cruelty of really teaching computing science"</a
            >
            perfectly sums up my gripes with how Computer Science is taught at a
            university level (at my school, at least).
          </p>
          <p>
            Succinctly put, my time learning computer science at my unnamed
            college exemplified nearly everything he (and I) believe a CS
            curriculum should <i>not do</i>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ignore the existential questions about computer programs (what are
              they? why do they exist? can they want? what should they be used
              for?)
            </li>
            <li>
              Ignore the notion of program behavior, i.e. provability (this is
              set aside as an advanced core class, counterintuitively reserved
              for a third or fourth year).
            </li>
            <li>
              Excessively simplify and frame new technologies with analogy,
              effectively instilling maladaptive thinking patterns that fail to
              extend to more novel problems
            </li>
            <li>
              Give up on doing the inverse of the above because it is too hard
              for young students.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Walking out of my third year, I left with the sad realization that I
            got by the majority of my classes by only understanding things as
            they pertained to assignments and exams.
            <b>And by "got by", I mean straight A's</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always knew something was wrong with how my school taught computer
            science (despite it being the biggest major as of 2025). As of late,
            though, I realized the gargantuan amount of damage it caused to my
            reasoning abilities. Damage that I have to reverse by, essentially,
            doing everything all over again.
          </p>

              >competitive programming journey</a
            >
            epitomizes this point: to this day I struggle with reasoning,
            argumentation, and understanding program behavior. I know how a
            segment tree works but can't formalize the constraints of a problem.
            I can do dynamic programming on trees but I can barely manipulate
            and work with primitive mathematical concepts such as the \(gcd\)
            function. I cannot think of a more useless skillset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly all of this is my fault. However,
            <i
              >it should not be possible for this to happen in a computer
              science curriculum</i
            >. In other words, Djikstra is right.
