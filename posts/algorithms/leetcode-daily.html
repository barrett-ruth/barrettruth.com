            <h3>understanding the problem</h3>
            <p>
              p is a combinatoric problem at heart. You have some slots for
              evens and some for primes, with a limited number of choices for
              each. Leverage the multiplication rule, which states that if you
              have \(n\) slots with \(x\) choices, you get \(x^n\) possible
              outcomes.
            </p>
            <h3>doing it</h3>
            <p>
              So, what's the answer? If we know which slots we have and the
              number of choices for them, we're done. Since this is leetcode,
              they don't let you think&mdash;they just give you the answer. You
              have 2 types of slots (even and odd indices) with 5
              (\(\{0,2,4,6,8\}\)) and 4 (\(\{2,3,5,7\}\)) choices respectively.
              Therefore, the answer is: \(5^{\text{# even slots}}\cdot4^{\text{#
              odd slots}}\) By counting or with small cases, we have
              \(\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil\) even slots and
              \(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\) odd slots. Let's submit it!
            </p>
            <p>
              And.... TLE. Checking <i>everything</i> when you submit your
              code&mdash;in this case, constraint \(n\leq 10^{16}\) informs us
              of something suspect. In the worst case, \(\frac{n}{2}\approx
              n^14\). This is far too many multiplications, so we can leverage
              binary exponentiation instead (and probably should've been the
              whole time!). Don't forget the mod.

              You can remove elements in groups of 3 <i>solely</i> from the

            <h3>problem statement</h3>
            <p>
              Given an array <code>nums</code> of integers and upper/lower
              integer bounds <code>upper</code>/<code>lower</code> respectively,
              return the number of unique valid index pairs such that: \[i\neq
              j,lower\leq nums[i]+nums[j]\leq upper\]
            </p>
            <h3>understanding the problem</h3>
            <p>
              This is another sleeper daily in which a bit of thinking in the
              beginning pays dividends. Intuitively, I think it makes sense to
              reduce the &ldquo;dimensionality&rdquo; of the problem. Choosing
              both <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> concurrently seems tricky,
              so let&apos;s assume we&apos;ve found a valid <code>i</code>. What
              must be true? Well: \[i\neq j,lower-nums[i]\leq nums[j]\leq
              upper-nums[i]\]
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn&apos;t seem like we&apos;ve made much progress. If nums
              is a sequence of random integers,
              <i
                >there&apos;s truly no way to find all <code>j</code> satisfying
                this condition efficiently</i
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following question naturally arises: can we modify our input
              to find such <code>j</code> efficiently? Recall our goal: find the
              smallest/largest j to fit within our altered bounds&mdash;in other
              words, find the smallest \(x\) less/greater than or equal to a
              number. If binary search bells aren&apos;t clanging in your head
              right now, I&apos;m not sure what to say besides keep practicing.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, it would be nice to sort <code>nums</code> to find such
              <code>j</code> relatively quickly. However:
              <i>are we actually allowed to do this?</i> This is the core
              question I think everyone skips over. Maybe it is trivial but it
              is important to emphasize:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style: none">
              <li>
                <i>Yes, we are allowed to sort the input</i>. Re-frame the
                problem: what we are actually doing is choosing distinct
                <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> to satisfy some condition. The
                order of <code>nums</code> does not matter&mdash;rather, its
                contents do. Any input to this algorithm with
                <code>nums</code> with the same contents will yield the same
                result. If we were to modify <code>nums</code> instead of
                rearrange it, this would be invalid because we could be
                introducing/taking away valid index combinations.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Let&apos;s consider our solution a bit more before implementing
              it:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Is the approach feasible? We&apos;re sorting
                <code>nums</code> then binary searching over it considering all
                <code>i</code>, which will take around \(O(nlg(n))\) time.
                <code>len(nums)</code>\(\leq10^5\), so this is fine.
              </li>
              <li>
                How do we avoid double-counting? The logic so far makes no
                effort. If we consider making all pairs with indices
                <i>less than</i> <code>i</code> for all
                <code>i</code> left-to-right, we&apos;ll be considering all
                valid pairs with no overlap. This is a common pattern&mdash;take
                a moment to justify it to yourself.
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Exactly</i> how many elements do we count? Okay, we&apos;re
                considering some rightmost index <code>i</code> and we&apos;ve
                found upper and lower index bounds <code>j</code> and
                <code>k</code> respectively. We can pair
                <code>nums[j]</code> with all elements up to an including
                <code>nums[k]</code> (besides <code>nums[j]</code>). There are
                exactly \(k-j\) of these. If the indexing confuses you, draw it
                out and prove it to yourself.
              </li>
              <li>
                How do we get our final answer? Accumulate all
                <code>k-j</code> for all <code>i</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>carrying out the plan</h3>
            <p>
              The following approach implements our logic quite elegantly and
              directly. The third and fourth arguments to the
              <code>bisect</code> calls specify <code>lo</code> (inclusive) and
              <code>hi</code> (exclusive) bounds for our search space, mirroring
              the criteria that we search across all indices \(\lt i\).
            </p>
            <div class="code" data-file="cfps-naive.py"></div>
            <h3>optimizing the approach</h3>
            <p>
              If we interpret the criteria this way, the above approach is
              relatively efficient. To improve this approach, we&apos;ll need to
              reinterpret the constraints. Forget about the indexing and
              consider the constraint in aggregate. We want to find all \(i,j\)
              with \(x=nums[i]+nums[j]\) such that \(i\neq j,lower\leq x\leq
              upper\).
            </p>
            <p>
              We <i>still</i> need to reduce the &ldquo;dimensionality&rdquo; of
              the problem&mdash;there are just too many moving parts to consider
              at once. This seems challening. Let&apos;s simplify the problem to
              identify helpful ideas: pretend <code>lower</code> does not exist
              (and, of course, that <code>nums</code> is sorted).
            </p>
            <p>
              We&apos;re looking for all index pairs with sum \(\leq upper\).
              And behold: (almost) two sum in the wild. This can be accomplished
              with a two-pointers approach&mdash;this post is getting quite long
              so we&apos;ll skip over why this is the case&mdash;but the main
              win here is that we can solve this simplified version of our
              problem in \(O(n)\).
            </p>
            <p>
              Are we any closer to actually solving the problem? Now, we have
              the count of index pairs \(\leq upper\). Is this our answer?
              No&mdash;some may be too small, namely, with sum \(\lt lower\).
              Let&apos;s exclude those by running our two-pointer approach with
              and upper bound of \(lower-1\) (we want to include \(lower\)).
              Now, our count reflects the total number of index pairs with a sum
              in our interval bound.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this really is just running a prefix sum/using the
              &ldquo;inclusion-exclusion&rdquo; principle/however you want to
              phrase it.
            </p>

            <h3>some more considerations</h3>
            <p>
              The second approach is <i>asymptotically</i> equivalent. However,
              it&apos;s still worth considering for two reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If an interviewer says &ldquo;assume <code>nums</code> is
                sorted&rdquo; or &ldquo;how can we do
                better?&rdquo;&mdash;you&apos;re cooked.
              </li>
              <li>
                (Much) more importantly, it&apos;s extremely valuable to be able
                to <i>reconceptualize</i> a problem and look at it from
                different angles. Not being locked in on a solution shows
                perseverance, curiosity, and strong problem-solving abilities.
              </li>

            <h3>problem statement</h3>
            <p>
              Given an array <code>items</code> of \((price, beauty)\) tuples,
              answer each integer query of \(queries\). The answer to some
              <code>query[i]</code> is the maximum beauty of an item with
              \(price\leq\)<code>items[i][0]</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>understanding the problem</h3>
            <p>
              Focus on one aspect of the problem at a time. To answer a query,
              we need to have considered:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Items with a non-greater price</li>
              <li>The beauty of all such items</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Given some query, how can we <i>efficiently</i> identify the
              &ldquo;last&rdquo; item with an acceptable price? Leverage the
              most common pre-processing algorithm: sorting. Subsequently, we
              can binary search <code>items</code> (keyed by price, of course)
              to identify all considerable items in \(O(lg(n))\).
            </p>
            <p>
              Great. Now we need to find the item with the largest beauty.
              Na&iuml;vely considering all the element is a
              <i>correct</i> approach&mdash;but is it correct? Considering our
              binary search \(O(lg(n))\) and beauty search \(O(n)\) across
              \(\Theta(n)\) queries with
              <code>len(items)<=len(queries)</code>\(\leq10^5\), an
              \(O(n^2lg(n))\) approach is certainly unacceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider alternative approaches to responding to our queries. It
              is clear that answering them in-order yields no benefit (i.e. we
              have to consider each item all over again, per query)&mdash;could
              we answer them in another order to save computations?
            </p>
            <p>
              Visualizing our items from left-to-right, we&apos;s interested in
              both increasing beauty and prices. If we can scan our items left
              to right, we can certainly &ldquo;accumulate&rdquo; a running
              maximal beauty. We can leverage sorting once again to answer our
              queries left-to-right, then re-order them appropriately before
              returning a final answer. Sorting both <code>queries</code> and
              <code>items</code> with a linear scan will take \(O(nlg(n))\)
              time, meeting the constraints.
            </p>
            <h3>carrying out the plan</h3>
            <p>
              A few specifics need to be understood before coding up the
              approach:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Re-ordering the queries: couple <code>query[i]</code> with
                <code>i</code>, then sort. When responding to queries in sorted
                order, we know where to place them in an output
                container&mdash;index <code>i</code>.

            <h3>problem statement</h3>
            <p>
              Given an array of non-negative integers \(num\) and some \(k\),
              find the length of the shortest non-empty subarray of nums such
              that its element-wise bitwise OR is greater than or equal to
              \(k\)&mdash;return -1 if no such array exists.
            </p>
            <h3>developing an approach</h3>
            <p>Another convoluted, uninspired bitwise-oriented daily.</p>
            <p>
              Anways, we&apos;re looking for a subarray that satisfies a
              condition. Considering all subarrays with
              <code>len(nums)</code>\(\leq2\times10^5\) is impractical according
              to the common rule of \(\approx10^8\) computations per second on
              modern CPUs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Say we&apos;s building some array <code>xs</code>. Adding another
              element <code>x</code> to this sequence can only increase or
              element-wise bitwise OR. Of course, it makes sense to do this.
              However, consider <code>xs</code> after&mdash;it is certainly
              possible that including <code>x</code> finally got us to at least
              <code>k</code>. However, not all of the elements in the array are
              useful now; we should remove some.
            </p>
            <p>
              Which do we remove? Certainly not any from the
              middle&mdash;we&apos;d no longer be considering a subarray. We can
              only remove from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, how many times do we remove? While the element-wise bitwise
              OR of <code>xs</code> is \(\geq k\), we can na&iuml;vely remove
              from the start of <code>xs</code> to find the smallest subarray.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, what&apos; the state of <code>xs</code> after these
              removals? Now, we (may) have an answer and the element-wise
              bitwise OR of <code>xs</code> is guaranteed to be \(\lt k\).
              Inductively, expand the array to search for a better answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach is generally called a variable-sized &ldquo;sliding
              window&rdquo;. Every element of
              <code>nums</code> is only added (considered in the element-wise
              bitwise OR) or removed (discard) one time, yielding an
              asymptotically linear time complexity. In other words, this is a
              realistic approach for our constraints.
            </p>
            <h3>carrying out the plan</h3>
            <p>Plugging in our algorithm to my sliding window framework:</p>
            <div class="code" data-file="msl-naive.py"></div>
            <p>Done, right? No. TLE.</p>
            <p>
              If you thought this solution would work, you move too fast.
              Consider <i>every</i> aspect of an algorithm before implementing
              it. In this case, we (I) overlooked one core question:
            </p>
            <ol style="list-style: none">
              <li><i>How do we maintain our element-wise bitwise OR</i>?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Calculating it by directly maintaining a window of length \(n\)
              takes \(n\) time&mdash;with a maximum window size of \(n\), this
              solution is \(O(n^2)\).
            </p>
            <p>
              Let&apos;s try again. Adding an element is simple&mdash;OR it to
              some cumulative value. Removing an element, not so much.
              Considering some \(x\) to remove, we only unset one of its bits
              from our aggregated OR if it&apos;s the &ldquo;last&rdquo; one of
              these bits set across all numbers contributing to our aggregated
              value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, to maintain our aggregate OR, we want to map bit
              &ldquo;indices&rdquo; to counts. A hashmap (dictionary) or static
              array will do just find. Adding/removing some \(x\) will
              increment/decrement each the counter&apos;s bit count at its
              respective position. I like to be uselessly specific
              sometimes&mdash;choosing the latter approach, how big should our
              array be? As many bits as represented by the largest of
              \(nums\)&mdash;(or \(k\) itself): \[\lfloor \lg({max\{nums,k
              \})}\rfloor+1\]
            </p>
            <p>Note that:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Below we use the

              </li>
              <li>
                It&apos;s certainly possible that \(max\{nums, k\}=0\). To avoid
                the invalid calculation \(log(0)\), take the larger of \(1\) and
                this calculation. The number of digits will then (correctly) be
                \(1\) in this special case.

              Given some \(x\) and \(n\), construct a strictly increasing array
              (say
              <code>nums</code>
              ) of length \(n\) such that
              <code>nums[0] & nums[1] ... & nums[n - 1] == x</code>
              , where
              <code>&</code>
              denotes the bitwise AND operator.

              Finally, return the minimum possible value of

            </p>
            <h3>understanding the problem</h3>
            <p>
              The main difficulty in this problem lies in understanding what is
              being asked (intentionally or not, the phrasing is terrible). Some
              initial notes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The final array need not be constructed</li>
              <li>
                If the element-wise bitwise AND of an array equals
                <code>x</code> if and only if each element has
                <code>x</code>&apos;s bits set&mdash;and no other bit it set by
                all elements
              </li>
              <li>
                It makes sense to set <code>nums[0] == x</code> to ensure
                <code>nums[n - 1]</code> is minimal
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>developing an approach</h3>
            <p>
              An inductive approach is helpful. Consider the natural question:
              &ldquo;If I had correctly generated <code>nums[:i]</code>&rdquo;,
              how could I find <code>nums[i]</code>? In other words,
              <i
                >how can I find the next smallest number such that
                <code>nums</code>
                &apos;s element-wise bitwise AND is still \(x\)?</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Hmm... this is tricky. Let&apos;s think of a similar problem to
              glean some insight: &ldquo;Given some \(x\), how can I find the
              next smallest number?&rdquo;. The answer is, of course, add one
              (bear with me here).
            </p>
            <p>
              We also know that all of <code>nums[i]</code> must have at least
              \(x\)&apos;s bits set. Therefore, we need to alter the unset bits
              of <code>nums[i]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key insight of this problem is combining these two ideas to
              answer our question:
              <i
                >Just &ldquo;add one&rdquo; to <code>nums[i - 1]</code>&apos;s
                unset bits</i
              >. Repeat this to find <code>nums[n - 1]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              One last piece is missing&mdash;how do we know the element-wise
              bitwise AND is <i>exactly</i> \(x\)? Because
              <code>nums[i > 0]</code> only sets \(x\)&apos;s unset bits, every
              number in <code>nums</code> will have at least \(x\)&apos;s bits
              set. Further, no other bits will be set because \(x\) has them
              unset.
            </p>
            <h3>carrying out the plan</h3>
            <p>Let&apos;s flesh out the remaining parts of the algorithm:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>len(nums) == n</code> and we initialize
                <code>nums[0] == x</code>. So, we need to &ldquo;add one&rdquo;
                <code>n - 1</code> times
              </li>
              <li>
                How do we carry out the additions? We could iterate \(n - 1\)
                times and simulate them. However, we already know how we want to
                alter the unset bits of <code>nums[0]</code> inductively&mdash;
                (add one) <i>and</i> how many times we want to do this (\(n -
                1\)). Because we&apos;re adding one \(n-1\) times to
                \(x\)&apos;s unset bits (right to left, of course), we simply
                set its unset bits to those of \(n - 1\).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The implementation is relatively straightfoward. Traverse \(x\)
              from least-to-most significant bit, setting its \(i\)th unset bit
              to \(n - 1\)&apos;s \(i\)th bit. Use a bitwise mask
              <code>mask</code> to traverse \(x\).
            </p>
            <div class="code" data-file="minend.cpp"></div>
            <h3>asymptotic complexity</h3>
            <p>
              <u>Space Complexity</u>: \(\Theta(1)\)&mdash;a constant amount of
              numeric variables are allocated regardless of \(n\) and \(x\).
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>Time Complexity</u>: in the worst case, may need to traverse
              the entirety of \(x\) to distribute every bit of \(n - 1\) to
              \(x\). This occurs if and only if \(x\) is all ones (\(\exists
              k\gt 0 : 2^k-1=x\))). \(x\) and \(n\) have \(lg(x)\) and \(lg(n)\)
              bits respectively, so the solution is \(O(lg(x) + lg(n))\in
              O(log(xn))\). \(1\leq x,n\leq 1e8\), so this runtime is bounded by
              \(O(log(1e8^2))\in O(1)\).
