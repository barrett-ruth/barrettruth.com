              While working for
              <a href="https://trbcap.com/">TRB Capital Management</a>, certain
              strategies necessitated finding the minimum and maximum of a
              moving window of prices.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2>problem statement</h2>
          <p>Design a data structure supporting the following operations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span><code>build(size_t capacity)</code></span>
              : initialize the data structure with capacity/window size
              <span><code>capacity</code></span>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The data structure must always hold \(\leq\)
                <span><code>capacity</code></span>
                prices.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <span><code>void push_back(double value)</code></span>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the data structure exceeds capacity, remove elements from the
                front of the window.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <span><code>void pop_front()</code></span>
              : remove the price from the front of the window

            <li>
              <span><code>size_t size()</code></span>
              : return the number of prices in the data structure

            <li>
              <span><code>double get()</code></span>
              : return the extrema (min or max)

          <h2>solution</h2>
          <p>
            Try to solve it yourself first. The point of this exercise it to
            create the most theoretically optimal solution you can, not
            brute-force and move on.

            <h3>na&iuml;ve solution</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="problem-content">
            <p>
              One can design a data structure meeting these requirements through
              simulating the operations directly with a
              <a
                target="blank"
                href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque"
                ><span><code>std::deque&lt;double&gt;</code></span></a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the upside, this approach is simple to understand. Further,
              operations are all \(O(1)\) time&mdash;that is, nearly all
              operations. The minimum/maximum element must be found via a linear
              scan in \(O(n)\) time, certainly far from optimal.
            </p>
            <div class="code" data-file="naive.cpp"></div>
          </div>
          <h3>optimizing the approach</h3>
          <div class="problem-content">
            <p>
              Rather than bear the brunt of the work finding extrema in calls to
              <span><code>get()</code></span
              >, we can distribute it across the data structure as it is built.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maintaining the prices in a sorted order seems to suffice, and
              gives access to both max <i>and</i> min in \(O(1)\) time. However,
              all of the problem constraints have not been addressed. Adhering
              to the interface of a circular buffer is another challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately, pairing each element with a count allows intelligent
              removal/insertion of elements&mdash;if an element has a count of
              \(0\), remove it from the list of sorted prices. A
              <a
                target="blank"
                href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map"
                >std::map</a
              >
              allows us to do all of this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, we can access extrema instantly. Insertion and deletion take
              \(O(log(n))\) time thanks to the map&mdash;but we can do better.

          <h3>monotonic <s>queues</s> deques</h3>
          <div class="problem-content">
            <p>
              Thinking a bit deeper about the problem constraints, it is clear
              that:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If an extrema is pushed onto the data structure, all previously
                pushed elements are irrelevant to any further operations.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Elements are processed in FIFO order, enabling this observation to
              be exploited. This is the foundationl idea of the
              <a
                target="blank"
                href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monotone_priority_queue"
                >monotone priority queue</a
              >
              data structure. So, for maintaining a minimum/maximum, the data
              structure will store a monotonically increasing/decreasing
              double-ended queue.
            </p>
            <p>
              This solution does not satisfy a circular buffer inherently. If an
              arbitrary number of elements are removed from the data structure
              when an extrema is added, it is certainly not possible to maintain
              a window of fixed size.
            </p>
            <p>Thus, we make one more observation to meet this criterion:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If each price (extrema) on the monotonic double-ended queue also
                maintains a count of <i>previously popped elements</i>, we can
                deduce the proper action to take when the data structure reaches
                capacity.
              </li>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If elements were previously popped before this extrema was
                  added to the data structure, decrement the price&apos;s count
                  of popped elements and do nothing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Otherwise, either no elements were pushed before this extrema
                  or they&apos;ve all been popped. Remove (pop) this element
                  from the deque.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This approach supports all operations in amortized \(O(1)\) time
              (with a monotonic sequence, elements are added or removed at least
              once; across a sequence of \(n\) operations, \(n\) total \(O(1)\)
              operations will be executed).
