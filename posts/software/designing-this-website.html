          <h2>HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</h2>
          <p>That&apos;s all there is to it.</p>
          <p>I thought about using the following frameworks:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a target="blank" href="https://react.dev/">React.js</a></li>
            <li><a target="blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a></li>
            <li><a target="blank" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></li>
            <li><a target="blank" href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            But I did not actually <i>need</i> any of them to make this site
            look decent.
          </p>
          <h2>What I&apos;ve Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Of course, most people build simple websites like these to learn a
            new technology or framework, not to use an optimal tool. That&apos;s
            actually why I
            <a
              target="blank"
              href="/posts/software/from-github-pages-to-aws.html"
              >hosted this website on AWS</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building this website with truly bare-bones technologies has made me
            appreciate <i>why</i> these web frameworks have emerged.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Writing JavaScript to manipulate the DOM works just fine but lacks
              the readability and composability that many JavaScript frameworks
              bring to the table.
            </li>
            <li>
              Re-using code is odd. For example, I created a
              &quot;common.js&quot; with general utilities&mdash;there is zero
              indication (both to me and my language servers) that these
              functions are exposed to other scripts included by the same HTML
              file.
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, CSS styling (inline/stylesheet) works at the small
              scale. However, with styles being completely divorced from the
              HTML itself, much is left to be desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reusing HTML, styles, and JavaScript feels extremely fragile.
              Innovative type-safe, optimized, and composable solutions
              definitely have their place in the web.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>You can be efficient with HTML, JS, and CSS.</b> My iteration
              speed on on this site versus other React.js/MDX blogs I have
              worked on is the same if not faster. While this may be a testament
              to my lack of JavaScript experience, I think people conclude too
              early that their task is beyond the technologies that form the
              foundation of the web today.
