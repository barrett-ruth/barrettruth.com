          <h2>pages begone</h2>
          <p>
            Though GitHub Pages may work for hosting your small, internal,
            static site, I don't think Pages is the right choice for
            <i>anyone</i>:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Bandwidth caps: scale your software by default</li>
            <li>
              Limited SEO control: not a downside if you don't want want
              traffic...
            </li>
            <li>Static &amp; client-side only: keep your options open</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>why aws?</h2>
          <p>
            I used pages before because I had little knowledge of cloud
            computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not a justification&mdash;if you are a software developer,
            learn it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to hosting this site, I developed and hosted an internal
            application with Google Cloud while working at
            <a href="https://nthventure.com">nth Venture</a>. Getting a single
            Compute Engine up and running made me step away from cloud for the
            entire next year.
          </p>
          <p>AWS is:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Industry standard: not an actual reason but it convinced me
              nonetheless
            </li>
            <li>
              Secure: soon to be used by VISA, which holds security to a nearly
              stupid extent (seriously, I can&apos;t even clone a repository)
            </li>
            <li>
              Well-documented: everything in the documentation worked
              <i>first try</i>. This is extremely rare in software, so
              compliments to Chef Bezos.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>the setup</h2>
          <p>
            This website is pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>AWS-wise, I use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>S3, to host the content (static for now)</li>
            <li>CloudFront, to serve and cache said content</li>
            <li>Route53, to manage routing</li>
            <li>
              GoDaddy, to reserve
              <a target="_blank" href="https://barrettruth.com"
                >barrettruth.com</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>A user request can be modelled as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A user accesses the website by typing barrettruth.com in their
              browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              GoDaddy&apos;s DNS servers are queried, which translating the
              domain name to my Route53&apos;s IP address.
            </li>
            <li>
              Route53 then routes to the request to my CloudFront distribution
              associated with my S3 bucket.
            </li>
            <li>
              CloudFront checks its edge caches for the requested content. If
              the content is stale or not cached, CloudFront fetches the content
              from S3. Otherwise, it uses the cached content from an edge
              server.
            </li>
            <li>CloudFront returns the content to the user&apos;s browser.</li>
          </ol>
          <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
            <img
              width="50%"
              src="/public/posts/website-design.webp"
              alt="system design of my portfolio website"
            />
          </div>
          <h2>difficulties</h2>
          <p>
            The hardest part of hosting this website was interfacing with
            GoDaddy.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, configuring SSL certificates with GoDaddy is needlessly
            challenging. Follow
            <a
              target="blank"
              href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-godaddy.html"
              >AWS&apos;s guide</a
            >
            if you really want to. Otherwise,
            <a
              target="blank"
              href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/edit-my-domain-nameservers-664"
              >configure your GoDaddy nameservers</a
            >
            and point them to your own DNS service (like Route53) instead.
