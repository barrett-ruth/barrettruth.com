# the problem

I toggle between light and dark mode at at around 17:00 every day. Resetting my environment and theme across all my applications was a pain.

I use my color scheme [midnight.nvim](/git/midnight.nvim.html) on macOS and linux with these applications:

1. [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
2. [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
3. [sioyek](https://sioyek.info/)
4. [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)
5. [swaywm](https://swaywm.org/)
6. [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
7. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
8. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
9. [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
10. [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)

# criteria for solution

I run or trigger _one command_--every application updates automatically.

The feasability of this depends on the underlying support software has for dynamic reloading of configuration. In many cases this is not possible.

# the solution

As of November 28, 2025, I've created [this script](https://github.com/barrett-ruth/dots/blob/main/scripts/theme) which is bound by a [karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) and [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd) binding for macOS and linux, respectively.

## successes

1. neovim: I use my non-polling, macOS/linux-supporting automatic theme switcher [auto-theme.nvim](https://github.com/barrett-ruth/auto-theme.nvim)
2. ghostty: Ghostty supports [light and dark themes based on the system appearance](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)--easy.
3. sioyek: Any changes to user configuration are automatically reloaded--a script updates user preferences in-place
4. ungoogled-chromium: I folded and used the default system theme which automatically reads and updates according to the system environment
5. swaywm (linux): sway reads from a symlink'ed theme file `sed`ed, updated and reloaded by the script
6. rofi: `config.rasi` also reads from a symlink'ed theme files that is updated and reloaded by the script
7. fzf insert here - read from symlinked file?/cat?
8. tmux: `tmux.conf` reads from symlink'ed theme files that are automatically reloaded with `source-file`

## failures

Unfortunately, the following programs I've found nearly impossible to dynamically reload:

9. ripgrep: I use the default theme.

- The ripgrep global configuration file does not support environment variables, exterminating the option to provide a `${THEME}`-based path in the global configuration file.
- I'm also not willing to write an alias wrapper. I don't like to stray too far from the defaults.

10. zsh: it's impossible to update `$THEME` across all existing shells (simply a limit of posix). However, all affected _programs_ will read the proper `$THEME`--I'm fine compromising here.
