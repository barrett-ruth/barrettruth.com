# my goals

I wanted the following features in my competitive programming (cp) setup:

- Flexibility: support various environments (codeforces, USACO, cses, etc.) with ease
- Speed: instantaneous, non-blocking running/debugging; automatic environment configuration and easy code testing
- Editor-Agnostic: while I do provide first-in-class NeoVim integration for my setup, it should be easily portable to _any_ os/editor

# the solution

Some (POSIX-compliant, of course) scripts and a `makefile` are more than enough. I created the following intuitive way to interact with my CP setup:

1.  `make setup`: populate the environment with configurations in `~/.config/cp-template` for `clang-format` and `clangd`
2.  `make run file`
3.  `make debug file`
4.  `make clean`

That's it. The `makefile` relies on some scripts that compile code and run the corresponding executables.

Leveraging [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip), a custom `CP` user command, and some scripting for window management and asynchronous jobs, I'm able to:

- Asynchronously format, run, and debug code (`:h vim.system`)
- Use a three-window (input, output, and code) view
- Toggle between problems instantly (yes, the windows update)
- Automatically populate my coding buffers with competition-specific templates (i.e. USACO, CSES, etc.)
- Run the code from the CLI in less than a second
- Easily tweak and change the setup—there's absolutely nothing fancy.
