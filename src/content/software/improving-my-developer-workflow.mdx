# the problem

Everything about my workflow was slow.

# some context

Since May 2025, I've been using the same tmux+neovim-centric setup. Sessions house projects, performing different duties in different windows. It worked for me at the time. However, after a summer at DRW and a fall at Ramp, this became far from the case. During both internships I was met with more tools, third-party integrations, (begrudgingly) Macs, and a litany of previously irrelevant inefficiencies. Here are some problems that I ran into:

# the problems

- <u>Vibe coding</u>: I switched back and forth between
  Claude/Cursor/Windsurf/neovim in nearly every commit.
- <u>Poor OS understanding</u>: I waddled my way through the MacOS ecosystem. I
  barely understood how the OS, package managers, and display manager worked,
  preventing me from efficiently automating it.
- <u>Archaic git workflow</u>: Now that I was frequently collaborating on large
  codebases, I needed to context-switch rapidly. I could not. This was primarily
  due to two things:
  1. <u>Nonexistent task management system</u>: I used a raw `.txt` file to
     manage my priorities. I have also been known to use Chrome tabs as a backup
     todo list.

  2. <u>Poor workflow processes</u>: creating PRs, leaving reviews, and
     iterating was slow. Coding was slow. Typing was slow. My neovim broke _all_
     the time. It was nearly impossible to keep my Linux config in sync when I
     went home to code on personal projects.

# the solutions

- <u>Quit MacOS</u>: easy enough.
- <u>Quit vibe-coding</u>: I used vibe-coding to replace my train of thought
  rather than amplify it.
- <u>Constantly tweak</u>: Humility, coupled with the willingness to adapt,
  would render every point above moot. I constantly analyze and improve my
  config to a reasonable[^1] extent. For example, I recently extended a hyprland
  windowing script to interactively prompt for a desired selection. This is
  because I would consistently pull incorrect Chrome instances with multiple of
  them open at a time, forcing me to manually reorder them. Evidence of this
  constant iteration can be found in the revitalized history of my
  [dotfiles](https://github.com/barrett-ruth/dots).
- <u>Use tools that "just work"</u>: one of my friend's fathers told me that I
  was not special during a lacrosse practice in elementary school. I used many
  programs to feel special, from quirky Linux window managers to niche Neovim
  plugins. I eliminated tools that could not stand the test of time and
  sparingly chose well-regarded ones to replace them. For example, I dropped
  swaywm for hyprland and ungoogled-chromium for Google Chrome (see [my suckless
  post](/meditations/suck-less-or-suck-more.html)).
- <u>Manage tasks effectively</u>: develop a philosophy for prioritizing and
  solving problems. Find or make a program that implements it and immediately
  abandon *everything* else. [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) and some
  custom scripts worked for me.

## appendix: config changes, enumerated

Here are only a few of the config changes I made in the past month:

- Configure hyprland windows extensively to my needs. I can instantly pull and push any window in any workspace without having to memorize application-to-workspace number mappings.
- Perform all coding-related tasks in one neovim instance rather than separate windows. This creates an improved separation of concerns and seamless integration with git actions and project task management.
- Use taskwarrior for tasks and todo management.
- Use Google Chrome search engines as URL shortcuts, the [fuzzy url finder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ff-fuzzy-finder-for-chrom/dbgeolnmmjmhcfndmmahnpicpmnpibep?hl=en) chrome extension to find URLs, and [a tab numberer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-show-tab-numbers/pflnpcinjbcfefgbejjfanemlgcfjbna?hl=en) to find tabs.
- Make dotfiles OS-agnostic through a variety of OS-specific conditionals in configs and refactoring the directory structure to mirror that of the Unix-like file structure (my dots repo now has `.config`, `/etc` folders).
- Use [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) for quickly opening files. Waste a day of your life writing an awesome previewer that supports native (treesitter/vim syntax!) neovim highlighting and video/pdf/gif support. This thing is seriously cool--[check it out](https://github.com/barrett-ruth/dots/blob/main/.config/lf/lf.lua).
- Auto-theme switching (see [here](/git/auto-theme.nvim.html)).
- Swap to a stable AppImage build of my PDF reader, [sioyek](https://sioyek.info/), to avoid versioning dependencies.

[^1]: This is an art form. I leverage time-blocking, making changes _only_ based on evidence (i.e. how often do I perform this action in practice?) and intentionally selecting tools after extensive research/trial. I explored around 10 plugins before settling on [overseer.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/overseer.nvim) when configuring how to run tasks and projects.
